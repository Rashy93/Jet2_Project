# Jet2_Project
The objective of this sample project is to provide a sample project using react, node and mongoDB, to demonstrate a TimeKeeping system where a number of contractors in different areas have a centralised time keeping system. Something for contractors to record their time, so that it can be approved and invoiced appropriately.
